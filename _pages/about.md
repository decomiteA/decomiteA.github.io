Education and background 
======

I received my PhD in applied mathematics in February 2022. During my PhD at UCLouvain with Profs. Philippe Lefevre and Frederic Crevecoeur, I studied the dynamic aspects of control policies used by humans during reaching using experiments and models. I was a visiting PhD student from November 2021 to January 2022 in the lab of Andrew Pruszynski at the Western University of Ontario in London, Ontario. During my undergrad and master at UCLouvain, I studied applied physics with a specialization in spectroscopy through a combination of experimental and modeling work.


I am also involved in the Neuromatch Academy where I was the head of the operations department in 2023 and the matching coordinator in 2024.  



Other interests

In my free time, I enjoy reading science-fiction novelettes and short stories, learning new things through reading (history, science, maths), and hiking in the nature.
